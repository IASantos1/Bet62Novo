- `artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares/auth.ts` — JWT middleware for users
- `artifacts/api-server/src/middlewares/adminAuth.ts` — JWT middleware for admins
- `lib/db/src/schema/users.ts` — users DB schema
- `lib/db/src/schema/bets.ts` — bets DB schema
- `lib/db/src/schema/payments.ts` — payments DB schema (tracks ifthenpay orders)

## Admin Access

- URL: `/admin`
- Default username: `admin` OR email: `admin@bet62.com`
- Default password: `bet62admin2026`
- Override via env vars: `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- Admin JWT lasts 8 hours; stored in sessionStorage (clears on tab close)

## Ifthenpay Payment Flow

- **Multibanco**: `POST /api/payments/multibanco` → calls ifthenpay API → returns entity/reference → user pays at ATM → ifthenpay calls `GET /api/payments/callback?orderId=...&amount=...` → balance credited
- **MB WAY**: `POST /api/payments/mbway` → calls ifthenpay API with phone → user accepts on MB WAY app → webhook credits balance
- **Card**: `POST /api/payments/card` → calls ifthenpay API → returns PaymentUrl → user redirected to 3DS page → `GET /api/payments/card-return` credits balance
- Callback URL for ifthenpay backoffice: `https://{domain}/api/payments/callback`
- All payment orders stored in `payments` table with status: pending → completed/failed

## Architecture decisions

- Admin auth is separate from user auth — same SESSION_SECRET but JWT payload has `isAdmin: true`; no DB table needed for admin
- Admin login accepts username (`admin`) OR email (`admin@bet62.com`) — configurable via env vars
- Statpal live data is cached server-side for 30s to avoid rate limits; upcoming matches are static with computed advanced markets
- Real live endpoints: football v2/live, NBA v1/nba/livescores, NHL v1/nhl/livescores, tennis v1/tennis/livescores, volleyball v1/volleyball/livescores
- Tennis extras: v1/tennis/livestats (match stats: aces/DF/1stServe/winners), v1/tennis/daily/d-1 (yesterday's results), v1/tennis/tournament-list/atp|wta (active tournaments), v1/tennis/tournament/{id} (full draw: all rounds, match-by-match results + schedule), v1/tennis/standings/atp|wta (top 100 rankings with movement), v1/tennis/odds (pre-match odds: Home/Away + 1st Set winner, 11 bookmakers averaged with 2.5% margin, 1 min cache)
- Tennis odds matching: extractSurname strips ALL leading initials (regex `^([A-Z]\\. *)+`) to handle "T. A. Tirante" → "tirante"; keyed by `${date}-${surname0}-${surname1}` in both orders; odds floor at 1.01
- Basketball has no Statpal endpoint — simulated with persistent state; tennis/volleyball fall back to simulation when no live matches
- Simulated live state persists in module-level Maps (_bballMap, _tennisMap, _volleyMap, _hockeyMap) — scores advance incrementally, never jump
- Cash out value = (stake × originalOdds) / currentOdds × 0.92 (8% house margin)
- Admin bet settlement: marking a bet as "won" atomically credits the user's balance with potentialWin
- New user balance starts at €0.00 on registration
- Deposits are never credited immediately — only after ifthenpay webhook/card-return confirmation

## Product

- Betting platform with live scores (Statpal API), multiple odds markets, bet slip, and cash out
- Admin dashboard at /admin: stats overview, user management with balance adjustments, bet settlement
- Deposit via Multibanco, MB WAY, or Card (ifthenpay)
- Markets: Football (standard), Basketball (quartos/times), Tennis (jogos/placar), Hockey (períodos/especiais), Volleyball (por set/pontos)

## User preferences

- Language: Portuguese (PT) throughout the UI
- Currency: € (Euro)
- Dark theme (zinc/red color scheme)
- Always use `zod/v4` imports, never `zod`

## Gotchas

- Always run `pnpm run typecheck:libs` before `api-server typecheck` (lib must be built first)
- Statpal API base URL is `statpal.io` (not `statspal.io`) with `?access_key=` query param
- Admin credentials default to `admin` / `bet62admin2026` if env vars not set — change in production
- `req.params.id` must be cast with `String(req.params["id"])` in Express 5 (TS union type)
- ifthenpay callback URL must be configured in the ifthenpay backoffice portal pointing to `/api/payments/callback`
